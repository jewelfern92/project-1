						<p><span class="name">Gaggan Anand</span> , 36, is as fond of creating unexpected flavours that explode in the mouth as he is of challenging culinary convention. Years ago, the young chef tasted a large helping of derision when he quit the Taj hotel after just 11 months and he struggled for years to make a go of things in his hometown Calcutta.</p>
						<p>
						But now he's tasting the delicate flavours of success as he cooks up a storm with his eponymous restaurant Gaggan in Bangkok which he launched in December 2010.</p>
						<p>
						Anand is presenting Indian food like it has never been done before, using molecular gastronomy techniques that he'd picked up at Ferran Adria's El Bulli Lab — he was the first Indian to train with the legendary Catalan chef who pushed the boundaries of cuisine using high-tech methods to cook food in novel ways.</p>

						<p>The result: in just over three years, he's taken Gaggan with its Progressive Indian cuisine to third spot on the recently released <a href="http://www.theworlds50best.com/asia/en/list/previous-lists/2014-list.html">Asia's 50 Best Restaurants 2014</a> list (up from number 10 in 2013). Incidentally, Gaggan was also the only Indian restaurant to appear on the World's 100 Best Restaurants list, at 66, last year.</p>
						<div class="group">
							<p>"It's like winning an Oscar for your country. It feels good because when we started out, we were looking at creating something that had never been done before," grins the fearlessly innovative chef.</p>
							<p>Certainly, restaurants back home are even copying his signature dishes like <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/09/11/papdi-chaat-goes-molecular/">Papdi Chaat 2050</a> or yoghurt spherification — the milky white sphere looks like a poached egg but bursts with the flavours of papdi chaat. And super-chefs like Joan Roca of El Celler de Can Roca, the world's best restaurant in 2013, and Andoni Luis Aduriz of Mugaritz, the fourth-best restaurant, are raising a toast too.</p>
						</div>
						<p>"At the Asia awards, they were like, 'Everyone in Europe is talking about Gaggan, there's terrific interest in how we're cooking'," says Anand, who's got everyone from Thai royalty to Nita Ambani to Abhishek Bachchan raving about his food.</p>
						<p>Says chef Manish Mehrotra, who's doing a different kind of contemporary Indian cuisine at Indian Accent in Delhi: "Two-and-a-half years ago, nobody knew who Gaggan was. Now, he's everywhere. Nobody had done Indian food with molecular gastronomy before. What's more, Gaggan's taken Indian food global in Bangkok, which is not an Indian cuisine stronghold."</p>
						<div class="group">
							<p>Anand's also always innovating. Two months ago, he just dropped the a-la-carte menu at Gaggan — housed in a beautiful colonial house. Now, he only serves three tasting menus, all blind. There's Taste of Gaggan, which includes dishes like a foie gras with red onion chutney and a cold raspberry-hazelnut praline. Indian Cuisine Reinvented has his deconstructed-and-reconstructed take on familiar Indian dishes.</p>
							<p>"I've been changing simple Indian food," he says. And his 4,000-baht (about $125) Signature menu is made up of 22 courses like the Iberian pork neck slow-cooked in a Goan vindaloo reduction.</p>
						</div>
						<p>As for guests who don't understand his food, he says: "I'm not being arrogant. But you can't ask for a Toyota when you walk into a Ferrari showroom." There's more on his plate too. He's building a new bar and he's also setting up an El Bulli-inspired culinary research lab. "I'm not buying a Ferrari or house from my last year's profits. Instead, I'm going to create a lab, where we'll explore the boundaries of cooking," he says.He's even prepping for a restaurant in Mumbai soon which he insists won't be like Gaggan. But at the same time, he says: "Everyone keeps saying a Gaggan can only work outside India. I want to shut them up. That's how my mind works. Everything that is negative is turned into something positive." Before that, he'll do a pop-up here in September.</p>

							<p>Anand's offerings are all about his abiding Indian food memories his Calcutta favourites include Gupta Brothers and Kewpie's tossed with the finest ingredients and whipped up with the technical wizardry of molecular gastronomy. The result is delectable artistic creations that remain true in their essence to their origin.</p>
							<p>"When it goes into your mouth, it reminds you that you're in a place where you've been before. It's your Sunday morning papdi chaat, your after-dinner kulfi and paan. This is the taste I'm giving because this is what I come from," says Anand, who regularly visits India with his Thai wife to "revive my tastebuds".</p>
